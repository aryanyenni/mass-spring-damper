# Mass-Spring_Damper System Modeling / Simulation
This project simulates the behavior of a classical mass-spring-damper system using MATLAB + Simulink.
The model is based on the second-order differential equation that governs mechanical oscillations.

mx'' + cx' + kx = F(t)

## Objectives
- build a baseline simulation of the system using Simulink
- explore different damping cases (underdamped, critically damped, overdamped)
- observe system responses to various external inputs
- potentially add real-time tunable parameters and animation

## Files
'mass_spring_damper.slx' - main Simulink model
'fb_diagram.slx' - free-body-diagram, givens, to be used for animation
