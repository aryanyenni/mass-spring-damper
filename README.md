# Mass-Spring_Damper System Modeling / Simulation
This project simulates the behavior of a classical mass-spring-damper system using MATLAB + Simulink.
The model is based on the second-order differential equation that governs mechanical oscillations.

\[
m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + k x = F(t)
\]

## Objectives
- build a baseline simulation of the system using Simulink
- explore different damping cases (underdamped, critically damped, overdamped)
- observe system responses to various external inputs
- potentially add real-time tunable parameters and animation

## Files
'.slx' - main model
'scripts/'
'images/' - diagrams, scope outputs, and Simulink block programming screenshots
